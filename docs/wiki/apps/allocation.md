Rewarding and recognizing contributions.

## What is the Allocation app?

The Allocations app is used to propose a financial allocation meant to be distributed to multiple parties. Allocation proposals are forwarded to the Dot Voting app. The percentage of the allocation amount distributed to each party is determined based on the results of the Dot Vote.

Right... so if you want to set aside a portion of your DAOs tokens/budget for allocations, you can! Then on a regular interval members of the DAO can vote to allocate funds however they want. One example of this is rewarding outstanding community contributions. Think of it as an employee of the month program, but as often and as granular as you want. You could also have a charity that the DAO donates to on a regular basis, and the community could choose where to direct those funds. The options are limitless! If you think of a great usecase please let us know by opening an Issue :)

## How do I use the Allocation app?

Click on the Allocations app in the app drawer. Create a new allocation. Add a description and decide how much you want to put in that allocation. Then on a regular interval your DAO can vote to allocate the allocation however they want.
