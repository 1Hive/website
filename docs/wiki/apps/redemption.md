Allows members to cash out the DAO's native tokens for the assets held in a redemption vault.

## What is the redemption vault?

The redemption vault allows members of a DAO to cash in "merit" tokens against the accumulated assets that the DAO conrols in the redemption vault. It is assumed that "merit" is earned by doing work. When members of the DAO earn "merit" tokens for doing stuff or exchange that "merit" against the DAO's assets, it does not affect their membership.

1Hive has started working on a "redemptions" vault that allows members of a DAO to earn merit and cash it out against the assets in the redemption vault. For example there's 100ETH in a vault and 1000 outstanding merit and if you have 35 merit you could cash out 0.35 ETH. Very WIP but we'll post a prototype soon :)
