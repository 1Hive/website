Life is short and I trust you to vote like I would vote

## What is proxy voting?

Proxy voting (aka liquid democracy or delegate voting) is when you transfer your voting power to someone else. You do not lose or give away your voting power as you can take it back at any time. You're really just saying that you trust someone to vote in a way that aligns with your interests and you'll vote however they vote.

## What is it good for?

Saves people time if they don't want to research all the issues.
Helps for complex/technical topic where you might not know the right answer, but you know someone shares your values and also understands the situation better than you do.
