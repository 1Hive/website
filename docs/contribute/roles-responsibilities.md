## Workers

Anyone can contribute to the 1Hive DAO by engaging with the community on Keybase, creating new Issues on GitHub, working on open Issues on GitHub. This does not require anyone's permission. Reviewers can assign tasks to the contributor's GitHub account and pay out HONEY bounties to the worker's Ethereum address upon successful completion. This does not require any permissions within the 1Hive DAO.

The roles and responsibilities of curators can be found [here](https://1hive.org/contribute/projects-tasks#expectations-of-workers).

If a Worker earns (or purchases) HONEY, they will have HONEY voting rights within the [1Hive DAO](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xe520428C232F6Da6f694b121181f907931fD2211). This includes the following permissions in the HONEY token Voting app:
