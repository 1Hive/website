What are Dandelion Orgs you might ask? Dandelion Orgs are a suite of Aragon apps that, when combined, create an Aragon DAO that is functionally similar to <a href="https://molochdao.com">MolochDAO</a>. Unlike MolochDAO, however, each app can be used on it's own. If you're building an Aragon DAO and want one of the features from Dandelion Orgs you can install our apps with a few lines of code. You'll also be able to augment Dandelion Orgs with new Aragon apps as they are released.</p>
<p>Why did we take this approach? MolochDAO was developed with a philosophy of minimizing complexity and code footprint. The organization does not try and do everything, but what it does do it does very well. In contrast, Aragon has been built with a philosophy of modularity and code-reuse. The Aragon ecosystem is growing a library of useful, audited, off-the-shelf apps that can be used in any Aragon DAO. After reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/MolochDAOVentures/MolochDAO">MolochDAO specification</a> we determined the key features of MolochDAO that we wanted to replicate and set out to build them as Aragon apps. This would allow any Aragon organization to adopt similar mechanisms while also staying true to the Aragon development philosophy of creating modular and re-usable components.</p>
<p>The fundamental mechanism that defines MolochDAO is the ability for members to exit the organization with a proportional share of the organization's assets, so long as they have not recently voted to approve a pending proposal. This creates a <em>loose partnership</em> where members can exit before a bad or otherwise controversial decision is made. This guarantee reduces friction for collaboration in the first place.</p>
<p>In addition to providing this core feature, we wanted to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Members can redeem tokens for a proportional share of the organizations assets.</li>
<li>It is possible to restrict exit actions based on whether a member has voted yes in a pending proposal.</li>
<li>New members are able to propose a payment to the DAO in exchange for the DAO's native tokens.</li>
<li>Proposals require the proposer to lock tokens in order to ensure that the incentives of voters are aligned with their votes.</li>
<li>Users who vote no, or do not vote, can see whether a proposal has passed before deciding to exit.</li>
</ol>
<p>We expected this to be fairly straightforward. Turns out it's not. In order to make Dandelion Orgs work we dug into some of the lesser known features of the aragonOS like <a href="https://hack.aragon.org/docs/acl_IACLOracle">ACL Oracles</a>. ACL Oracles are small helper functions that plug in to Aragon's  access control list (ACL) to do more sophisticated permission evaluation. ACL Oracles are a complex and powerful feature of aragonOS. In the future we plan to write a more thorough post about how we used them and how others might do the same. This post, however, will will be a high level overview of the apps that combine to make the Dandelion Org template.</p>
<ul>
<li>Redemptions</li>
<li>Token Request</li>
<li>Time Lock</li>
<li>Delay</li>
<li>Dissent Voting</li>
</ul>
<p>These apps will be released individually for any Aragon DAO to use. We will also ship an easy to deploy template that combines all of these apps to create a Moloch like DAO on Aragon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Allows users to manage a list of eligible assets held within an organization's Vault and allows members of the organization to redeem (burn) organization token in exchange for a proportional amount of the eligible assets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Redemptions app is similar in purpose to that of MolochDAO's ragequit function. To accomplish this the logic of whether or not a member can redeem their token is externalized using Aragon's permission system.</p>
<p>Unlike the ragequit mechanism in MolochDAO, Redemptions works with both ETH and ERC20 tokens. An organization can manage an array of eligible tokens for members to offer in exchange for Dandelion Org tokens and/or to redeem from the vault. Like MolochDAO, members still receive a share of the DAO's assets proportional the amount of Dandelion Org tokens they are redeeming.</p>
<p>This allows Dandelion Orgs to hold a strategic portfolio of liquid assets as opposed to only ETH.</p>
<p>We started working on Redemptions before our <a href="https://github.com/aragon/nest/">Aragon Nest</a> grant was approved and it is currently available on Rinkeby. The <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/redemptions-app">Redemptions app Github Repo</a> has details and deployment instructions.</p>
<p>If you don't want to deploy Redemptions yourself you can <a href="https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/tryredemptions/0x18a9713625256548670ad979d51a6b9fad5b6c45">demo the functionality on rinkeby</a>. You'll then be able to mint yourself some Dandelion Org tokens and deem them for a portion of the DAO's assets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Allows users to propose minting tokens in exchange for a payment to the organization, subject to the approval of existing members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MolochDAO has two proposal types: one where shares are minted in exchange for tribute and another to allocate funds towards proposals.</p>
<p>We created the Token Request app to allow addresses to create a request for a Dandelion Org's membership tokens in exchange for any other ERC-20 tokens. Dandelion Org members can then choose to accept or deny the address's request. Dandelion Orgs will also be able to create proposals to allocate funds via the voting and finance apps. In addition, Dandelion Orgs also allow members to create many more types of proposals depending on how permissions are set and which apps are installed. With an app like <a href="https://twitter.com/lkngtn/status/1147237525150425089">Aragon Agent</a> Dandelion Orgs can create proposals that interact with any external contract.</p>
<p>We anticipate that the Token Request app will be of benefit, not just to Dandelion Orgs, but the wider Aragon ecosystem. One use case would be a form of permissioned fundraising. The Token Request app allows for selective and negotiated token sales. This is somewhat similar to the venture model where startups and investors negotiate, agree on a price, and then investors get voting rights and a share of the company in exchange for cash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Allows an organization to require users to lock a configurable amount of tokens for a configurable amount of time in order to forward an intent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In MolochDAO, members who submit a proposal are also required to place a deposit of 10 ETH. This deposit is held by the DAO until the proposal is resolved and then return to the member who submitted the proposal regardless of the vote outcome. Since proposals in MolochDAO are queued and processed one at a time, the amount of time the funds will be locked depends on the number of proposals currently in the queue. This discourages people from extending the proposal queue.</p>
<p>In a Dandelion organization, to avoid coupling the lock app to the voting app we have diverged a bit from MolochDAO's deposit mechanism. With the lock app the amount of time funds must be locked when submitting a proposal is dependent on the number of actions that particular address has submitted within a given time; not on the current number of pending proposals. So the more proposals an individual member submits, the more opportunity cost they face. We think this will work well despite the lock mechanism itself not being sybil resistant, because proposal submission is restricted to existing members and membership is permissioned.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the lock app could be designed to more closely resemble MolochDAO's deposit mechanism. To do this we would need to initialize  it with a voting app address and have the lock time be based on the number of pending proposals in the queue at the time the proposal is submitted. We felt that the lock app would be more broadly useful if its anti-spam mechanism was not dependent on a specific voting app implementation so we opted against this path. If there is demand for this specific implementation, we would consider creating a variation on our lock app to support this behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Allows an organization to require a configurable delay before an action may be executed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In MolochDAO, after a proposal passes it does not execute for an additional grace period. This period allows for members to become aware of a proposal passing and ragequit.</p>
<p>In both mechanisms the delay does not increase the amount of time when members are actually eligible to redeem, if someone voted yes they are only guaranteed the ability to exit for a window of time between the proposal they most recently voted yes on and the time of the proposal that triggered their desire to rage quit. This window will always be at the very end of the delay/grace period, so the delay or grace period should be thought of as a way to ensure that there is adequate awareness of proposals passing before they are actually executed, but users will need to plan to send a transaction within that window.</p>
<p>In our delay app we are also implementing pause/unpause and cancel permissions, which can be useful for supporting other processes. For example an ACL oracle could be used to allow cancelling proposals if the token supply has decreased by a configurable percentage. This pattern of implementing roles to pause/unpause and cancel pending actions will likely be implemented in other  voting and approval related Aragon apps to accommodate dispute resolution processes.</p>
<p>An example of a configuration which creates an internal dispute resolution process is as follows: Some permission can be granted to the delay app, and then the ability to forward an intent and pause can be granted to the lock app. Users can perform actions unilaterally by locking tokens, but anyone can pause the intent, and then a vote would only be required to unpause or cancel the action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tracks and returns whether a user should be able to perform an action based on their recent voting behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to effectively address our requirements we will need to fork the existing voting app provided by Aragon One and add some additional functionality. Specifically we need to keep a mapping between an address and the most recent proposal start time where the user voted <code>yes</code>. We also need to ensure that votes cannot be executed early and that proposal start times can be consistently spaced apart.</p>
<p>We can use the mapping to create a separate app, the <strong>Dissent Oracle</strong> that implements the ACL Oracle interface. The Dissent Oracle essentially returns true or false and can be referenced in Permissions. The Dissent oracle is initialized with the Voting app addresses and uses the new mapping to evaluate if the user has voted <code>Yes</code> on a proposal within a configurable time frame (for the dandelion template this will be the <code>voteDuration</code> + <code>delayDuration</code>, if they have then oracle returns false. We can use this to restrict the <code>redeem</code> function in redemptions, so that anyone who has voted <code>yes</code> within that time frame cannot exit.</p>
<p>This mechanism is quite a bit different than how <code>ragequit</code> is implemented in MolochDAO. In MolochDAO the voting and grace period are connected, and the voting app can track what the highest index of a vote a user has voted <code>yes</code> on and evaluate whether a proposal has been fully processed based on its index value. In a Dandelion org the voting app is connected to the delay app to create the voting and grace period and these apps are not aware of one another. So instead of relying on index values, the dissent oracle uses time since the last yes vote so that the creator can account for additional processes that happen after the vote passes (like the delay).</p>
<p>The main trade-off here is that in MolochDAO if someone votes yes on a proposal and it doesn't pass then it is considered immediately processed. With a Dandelion Org the user would not be eligible to rage quit again until after the proposals delay period. Both implementations ensure that if a user does not vote yes on a proposal that was created after a proposal which (if passed) would trigger them to exit, they will have an opportunity to exit.</p>

<p>We believe the proposed Dandelion organization template does a good job of replicating the core properties of MolochDAO. In addition, Dandelion organizations can easily incorporate apps like Agent and Payroll to extend their functionality beyond the original MolochDAO implementation.</p>
<p>Many of the individual Dandelion Org apps will be useful outside the context of MolochDAO-like organizations. This increases the overall value of Aragon as platform. Any existing DAO can install one or many Dandelion apps with just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>All this being said, the one area we cannot replicate is the simplicity and reduced code footprint of MolochDAO. By implementing MolochDAO's features as modular components on Aragon, we are explicitly sacrificing simplicity in favor of flexibility and extensibility. If you are looking to deploy an instance of MolochDAO exactly as it was originally designed, that will always be the better choice.

<p>This is a refinement of my <a href="https://medium.com/hive-commons/introducing-hive-commons-95dad77814bb">proposal for a new open source license</a> intended to provide a practical alternative to strict copyleft or permissive style open source licensing. This post discusses how such a license could use a self-assessed tax as a means to self-regulate and grow a digital commons. This idea was inspired by Posner and Weyl’s excellent book Radical Markets, and helps to simplify how the license would work and resolve some legitimate concerns about uncertainty risks in the initial proposal.</p>

<p>The critical difference between permissive and copyleft style licenses is their approach to growing the value of the their respective commons. Advocates of permissive licensing argue that by making the software more accessible to commercial applications you attract wider adoption and through wider adoption attract more resources, attention, and ultimately more voluntary code contributions. In contrast, advocates of copyleft style licenses argue that without strictly enforcing that derivative works also remain open source, only a subset of application functionality remains open, and this subset tends to be commercial infrastructure rather than complete end-user applications. As a result, copyleft advocates believe that the creation of proprietary derivative works actively devalues the work’s original public source.</p>
<p>This tactical distinction has polarized the open source community into two ideological groups and resulted in software that is under-utilized due to license compatibility issues. In an ideal world, both groups could reach consensus and benefit from increased compatibility and a richer pool of open source software.</p>
<p>The introduction of a novel license could help bridge this ideological gap by providing a more balanced way to enforce on-going contributions to the commons than the all or nothing approaches of copyleft and permissive licensing respectively.</p>

<p>In order to provide a practical middle ground between copyleft and permissive licenses we need a legitimate way to assess the value of proprietary derivative works and provide compensation for any negative impact the work may have on the commons. The challenge is that it can be difficult to assess the value of something like intellectual property, which is non-fungible and rarely changes hands, in both a fair and efficient manner.</p>
<p>An elegant solution to this challenge was proposed in the context of property taxes by the economist Arnold Harberger. Harberger’s model for a self-assessed tax required individuals to set the value of their property and pay taxes based on their self-assessed valuation. To ensure that it is in the interest of the individual to self-assess accurately, they are required to sell their property at their self-assessed valuation if they are approached by a buyer. This mechanism generalizes well and is the basis of Posner and Weyl’s proposed common ownership self-assessed tax or COST that they describe in detail in their paper <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jla/article/9/1/51/3572441">“Property is only another form of monopoly.”</a></p>
<p>If we apply this type of self-assessed taxation in the context of an open source license we might end up with a license with the following basic provisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Software under this license can be used freely so long as any derivative works are provided open source and under the same license.</li>
<li>Software under this license can be used while keeping derivative works proprietary, but such derivative works are subjected to a self-assessed tax so long as they remain proprietary.</li>
<li>If a proprietary derivative work’s owner is paid their self-assessed valuation they must immediately open source the propriertary derivative work.</li>
</ol>
<p>(For clarity throughout the rest of this post we can call this hypothetical license the Hive Commons License or HCL)</p>
<p>The first provision would create a viral quality to the license similar to existing copyleft licenses, while the second and third provisions provide an alternative means of compliance that allows for use of the software for proprietary commercial applications while still ensuring that such uses fairly and consistently grow the commons.</p>
<p>Even if the revenue from such taxes are completely ignored, the cost of keeping works proprietary as opposed to releasing them open source would incent users of the license to include their derivative works in the commons rather than keeping the work proprietary. Or at least provide an accurate valuation that allows interested parties to pull the work into the commons if they desire. However, as the commons grows the revenue generated from taxes may become significant, and so its important to consider how such revenue would be allocated.</p>
<p>At this point I’m not sure what the best approach is and would be interested in what others think (hop on the <a href="https://keybase.io/team/1hive">1Hive Keybase chat!</a>), but the following approaches seem like they would be worth considering:</p>

Self-directed donations towards charitable causes</h3>
<p>A non-profit foundation could be charted to create a whitelist of approved charitable organizations that meet some yet to be defined criteria (perhaps organizations which are charted to grow the commons, or perhaps any organization that serves a charitable purpose), then when a user is required to pay a tax they can self-direct their tax liability as a donation towards an approved charitable organization.</p>

A social dividend</h3>
<p>Another approach would be to have all funds donated to a single non-profit organization chartered to simply provide a social dividend to all individuals globally. Such a dividend could become significant over time and have a huge impact, most noticieably in the poorest parts of the world.</p>
<p>By ensuring that the value of the commons is routed directly to the public in a straighforward and fair way, individuals could use their dividend for any purpose. While this would not necessarilly mean the funds would directly grow the commons, it would strongly align growth of the commons with the interests of the public and would likely result in difficult to quantify but significant contributions.</p>

A public commonwealth</h3>
<p>The third, and perhaps most interesting approach, is to use the funds to create a publicly governed digital commonwealth. This would have many of the same benefits that a social dividend would have, but could also ensure that all revenue generated by proprietary usage of HCL licensed software would be used to further grow the commons.</p>
<p><strong>A non-profit entity would be chartered to facilitate identity verification and grant all unique individuals governance shares in the commonwealth.</strong> These shares could be provided on a rolling basis and freely traded, providing recipients something very similiar to a social dividend. Governance shares would allow users to propose and vote on how funds should be used to grow the commons. Since users would already have verified identies, this application may be well suited for another proposal talked about in Radical Markets —  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">Quadratic Voting</a>.</p>
<p>Having the funds be controlled by an on-chain entity would simplify the implementation and administration requirements for the foundation significantly, as it would only be necessarily for them to provide identity attestions for unique individuals. Everything else could be administered reliably and autonomously using smart contracts. By leveraging existing infrastructure provided <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://aragon.org/">Aragon</a>, and <a href="https://www.uport.me/">Uport</a> much of the technical implementation would be integrating existing components into a practical application.</p>

<p>Liquid Democracy is a more direct form of democracy which would not be feasible without an infrastructure that enables rapid, secure, transparent, and trusted continuous voting. Ethereum’s smart contracts, despite some currently unresolved scaling issues, provide a promising foundation for building that infrastructure. This post can be broken up into 3 functional areas that essentially explain what Liquid Democracy is, how Hive Commons is approaching implementing it on Ethereum, and how we anticipate using it to bring about social change.</p>

<p>There are many ways to implement a democratic process, but if we were to put the two most well known forms on a spectrum you would have Direct Democracy on one side, and Representative Democracy on the other. Liquid Democracy would fall somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1440/1*vMFloIdXWyCLYKvwj8eU8Q.png' /></p>
<p>Direct Democracy works well in situations where you have relatively few but incredibly important issues to decide on, but does not scale well when there are many issues, or issues which require expertise in a specific field. In these cases it is impractical for everyone to be well informed and make an educated choice about each issue. Representative Democracy resolves this problem by allowing the population to vote less frequently. Instead of directly voting on issues, voters elect representatives who specializes in the governance of the community — freeing up everyone else to focus on other things. Unfortunately, the economic incentives of representatives are only loosely tied to the best interest of the public, so the result is sub-optimal for the group.</p>
<p>Both Direct Democracy and Representative Democracy have their problems, but can Liquid Democracy really do a better job?</p>
<p>Yes, Instead of always voting directly, or electing representatives that vote on your behalf for a set period of time, Liquid Democracy enables voters to fluidly delegate their vote or override their delegates position as they see fit. In some forms of liquid democracy, voters are even able to delegate their vote to multiple people based on the type of issue in question. It is essentially the best parts of both systems without any obvious trade-offs. The result is a system that, at its core, is less susceptible to economic capture and more likely to reach outcomes that benefit the general voting population.</p>
<p>That’s the basics, but for a more thorough examination of Liquid Democracy compared to other forms, I highly recommend <a href='https://medium.com/organizer-sandbox/liquid-democracy-true-democracy-for-the-21st-century-7c66f5e53b6f'>Dominik Schiener’s 2015 post on the subject</a>.</p>
<p>Historically, the biggest problem was that it was not possible to implement until now. The good news is that with ubiquitous access to the internet and significant innovations in modern cryptography a functional liquid democracy is totally feasible. In fact, there is quite a bit of active research and development in progress… In addition to our project, the team at <a href='http://giveth.io/'>Giveth</a> is working on an implementation of delegated governance to direct charitable donations and is encouraging other developers to build and adapt it for other use cases. <a href='https://aragon.network/'>Aragon</a> , a blockchain governance startup that recently raised 24 Million Dollars, is actively pursuing Liquid Democracy as a core governance model for DAO entities on their network. In addition, <a href='https://commiteth.com/'>CommitETH</a>, the ,a href='https://status.im/'&gt;Status</a> backed project, is working on integrating liquid democracy based governance directly into Github to enable SNT holders to direct the larger open source project. As much as we can (and they are willing) we’d like to collaborate to build out a general purpose implementation of liquid democracy that can be adopted in a wide range of decentralized community governance applications.</p>
<p>In the spirit of that, I’d like to share our thoughts on the user requirements and technical implementation choices we are considering for <a href='https://github.com/HiveCommons/Hive-Democracy'>Hive Commons’ implementation of Liquid Democracy</a>.</p>

<p>Developing software is all about finding the right balance utility, feasibility, and cost. Hive Commons has been exploring the following users stories as a foundation for an ideal liquid democracy implementation, while balancing and assessing implementation tradeoffs to ensure that the end result is technically feasible and reasonably cost efficient.</p>

<p>This is the core property of delegative democratic voting and is a must have. It is important to note that in this minimal case delegates must volunteer and commit to casting a direct vote, and a user will only be able to delegate their vote to a delegate not another regular voter.</p>

<p>This would allow voters to delegate their vote to any other voter. Generally this is preferable as it allows users to form delegate chains where they trust another user to pick a delegate (or at least pick another user who will pick a delegate). This creates a strong chain of trust that flows through voters to the correct decision, and should be considered the ideal form of truly liquid democracy. However, these chains introduce significant complexity which generally boils down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>What depth can chains go before it becomes computationally infeasible to tabulate votes?</li>
<li>How do we prevent infinite delegation loops?</li>
</ul>
<p>As we experiment with our designs we will be attempting to get as close to the ideal form of liquid democracy, while working within the constraint of limited and expensive computation. We are exploring state-channels and/or computation courts as a way to get closer to this ideal.</p>

<p>Another component of an ideal liquid democracy is the ability to conditionally delegate certain types of issues to different delegates based on your trust in their specific domain expertise or value structure. You may trust someone to make decisions on your behave about your financial well being but not your military. Or in the case of Hive Commons, you may trust your say in dispute resolution with oil companies with your friend who is deeply passionate about the environment.</p>
<p>We are exploring ways that this could be feasible on chain, as well as what it might look like as a client side application.</p>

<p>A critical property of liquid democracy is the ability for voters to constantly monitor the status their trusted delegate as the current standing of the vote and decide to step in and override their delegates decision. This is a significant check against any powerful delegate from defecting from the public interest for private gain.</p>

<p>This may help facilitate productive discussions by allowing strong chains of trust to form dynamically.

<p>Systems like <a href='http://carbonvote.com/'>CarbonVote</a> make it easy to read the results of a vote off-chain, but to get those same results on the chain (or back on the chain) in a trustless fashion may be challenging.</p>
<p>Currently our implementation tallies all votes on chain, however, in our attempt to support more complex delegation arrangements and minimize computational cost we may need to move the tallying of votes into state-channels and/or offload computation using <a href='http://www.oraclize.it/'>Oraclize</a>’s TLSNotary function, or a computation court like <a href='http://iex.ec/'>iex.ec</a> or <a href='https://golem.network/'>Golem</a> when they start to come online.</p>
<p>Regardless of the tactic used, it is important that we are able to return a secure and trusted result back to the blockchain.</p>

<p>A big shoutout to <a href='https://github.com/3esmit'>Ricardo Guilherme Schmidt</a>, for his help on this project so far. He has contributed our first implementation of delegative democracy to the <a href='https://github.com/HiveCommons/Hive-Democracy'>Hive Democracy repo</a> and has bee a huge part of the research and discussion of Hive Commons’ implementation of liquid democracy.</p>
<p>Our current code does not meet all of our requirements, but it is an excellent starting point. Currently it only supports a single delegation link rather than more complex delegate chaining scenarios, it does not yet support conditional delegation based on types of issues, or have any practical user experience designed to make voting more user-friendly and accessible — but we are making great progress!</p>
<p>As we continue towards this goal we welcome any and all feedback and collaboration. The more people thinking and working on this the more likely we are to reach an optimal solution. If you’d like to get involved the best place is on our <a href='https://github.com/HiveCommons'>Github</a> or on <a href='https://hivecommons.herokuapp.com/'>Slack</a>.</p>

<p>A friend of mine recently told me something that really stuck with me, he said, “Technology itself is rarely disruptive, instead it’s the economic consequences of technologies that have a transformative effect on the world.” In the context of Liquid Democracy that means that just because it is technically possible, does not mean it will have a significant impact unless it has a dramatic effect on our economic situation. I hadn’t thought about it in those terms before, but when I first heard about Liquid Democracy I had thought that it was a neat idea, but there wasn’t any reason that an established government would transition to this system because it resulted in a significantly worse economic position for the current leadership.</p>

<p>In short, we need to align the economic interests of those in power with our own goals before we can expect them to cooperate with us. Historically, the best approach seems to be to accumulate wealth and influence and then use that to lobby the government to implement those changes — and the most reliable way to accumulate wealth and influence is through compounding interest.</p>
<p>Compounding Interest occurs when the interest on a loan or deposit is added to the principal amount and begins to also earn interest. In other words, interest on interest.</p>
<p>This process is fairly straightforward to understand when the deposit or loan is an easily quantifiable resource such as a currency, but the positive feedback loop of compounding interest applies equally well to any resource which has value and can be accumulated.</p>
<p>Hive Commons will use Liquid Democracy to enable a community of activists to pool their resources into a commons, and collectively govern access to the commons to ensuring that the usage of the resources has a positive impact on the community, either by the user providing a general public service or directly contributing back to the commons. The result won’t always be quantifiable, but the wealth and influence of the community will exhibit the same growth patterns as compounding interest.</p>
<p>Eventually the community will be able to leverage this influence to bring about significant social and political changes, perhaps even lobbying for the adoption of Liquid Democracy by traditional governments. That won’t happen over night, compounding takes time, and there are many other technical and social hurdles before we even start that journey, but, it’s clear that there is potential for the technology to have dramatic economic consequences and a transformative impact on the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://hivecommons.org/">Hive Commons</a> is a grass roots movement intended to give the public a greater voice in industry and politics by using emerging technologies to enable new forms of collective activism.</p>
<p>The goal of Hive Commons is to enable a community of activists to pool their collective resources into a digital commons that is governed by a blockchain governance system based on the principles of Liquid Democracy. As the resources within the commons grow and become more valuable, the community will be able to offer access to the commons as leverage for collective bargaining.</p>
<p>Functionally, Hive Commons will act a bit like a public cartel, ensuring that the public goods within the commons are protected and grow overtime. If successful, this should offer a significantly more effective solution to Tragedy of the Commons challenges.</p>
<p>Imagine if Facebook was more accountable to the public than to its private shareholders and advertising partners? Imagine if collectively we could reward our political representatives contingent on their approval rating? The goal of Hive Commons is to provide a platform for collective activism that will make that a reality.</p>

<p>Historically collective action has been a highly effective way for communities to bring about societal changes, however, large scale collective action has been elusive as it is incredibly challenging to pull off. Often, the only thing a large group of people can agree on is that they don’t really agree on anything, and without consensus, collective action falls apart because individuals do not have enough leverage to make change by themselves.</p>
<p>Representative Democracy is so far the most successful form of organized collective action, but there are significant flaws. The first of which is that it relies on violent coercion rather than voluntary association to maintain authority, the second is that by electing representatives, we centralize authority in a relatively small population that is motivated by their own self-interest and subject to economic capture by third-parties. The result is a structure that provides some public benefit, but balances that benefit with private-interests sub-optimally. Arguably, many democratically governed nations have already devolved into thinly veiled oligopolies, controlled primarily by the interests of a wealthy elite.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, collective action is voluntary, and consensus is reached without a central authority. Hive Commons enables this type of activist organization, and while not a substitute for traditional governments in the sense that there may always need to be a need for a forceful authority to act as peacekeeper, it does offer a less corruptible alternative to representing the desires of a community and a means to realize that desire within the bounds of existing economic systems.</p>

<p>Participation in governance and dispute arbitration will require a new cryptographic token, at the time of writing Giveth’s MiniMe extension of the ERC20 Ethereum token standard seems like the best starting point. The token, currently called Honey (HNY), will be used in all voting activities within the community using a voting model based on liquid democracy. Research, discussion, and development of the voting system is being done in the Hive Democracy repository on Github.</p>
<p>This token must be widely distributed and checks must be put in place to prevent accumulation and centralization of power. There are a number of promising theoretical approaches to this, which should be explored in more detail, but initially the HNY token will have a significant hard-coded supply inflation that is distributed through faucets connected with uport for proof of individuality. This mechanism will work similar to basic income and ensure that the distribution of HNY will always trend towards public interest over time.</p>
<p>A user friendly interface for participating in the community is critical to the success of the project. The District0x project appears to be a promising start and much of the functionality they have already built, or plan to build, could serve as the foundation for the 1Hive community portal. The portal would provide a web3.0 enabled interface similar to Reddit.com, but allow novel interactions including funding and curation of initiatives, discussion, governance, and dispute resolution.</p>
<p>The 1Hive community and governance portal will be much more useful if there is some shared community commons to govern. There are a number of resources that would be a good fit for pooling within a commons — software, capital, patents, computation, storage, approval, and even attention. Each resource may require a unique approach to pooling. Hive Commons plans to focus on enabling pooling of software and capital first, but the infrastructure needed to support those should overlap significantly with other resources, making it simple to enable new resource types in the future.</p>

<p>Open Source software is an example of a digital commons, but existing open source software licenses struggle to govern access to software effectively. In fact there is a significant divide within the Open Source software community on how access to the software should be controlled. Are Copyleft licenses better than Permissive licenses in achieving the community goal of providing a more free and open society?</p>
<p>A Copyleft style license like the GPL has a viral clause that requires user to license any derivative works under the same license, thereby growing the community commons. The problem is that this mechanism is inflexible and generally not compatible with any sort of commercial application whatsoever. If a company builds a product that is 99% new code, and 1% GPL licensed code, the GPL license would require that the 99% must be open sourced and also licensed on the GPL, there is no middle ground for the company to opt to open source 1% of the new code in exchange for usage of the 1% of the GPL code they are licensing it is an “All or Nothing” proposition. The result is that GPL and other Copyleft licensed projects typically are developed primarily by volunteers in their free time and the project often lack the funding, polish, and utility of more mainstream products.</p>
<p>In contrast, a Permissive style license like the Apache license, does not have any viral restriction. Users can use the software in commercial applications without worrying about having a specific requirement to give back to the community. Though in practice, its often the case that in using the application they make improvements and bug fixes as they encounter them.</p>
<p>The Hive Commons License (HCL) will be a novel open source license based on the GPL, the official legal license still needs to be written and reviewed by legal experts, however, the general idea is that HCL licenses will have two options for compliance. Either license any derivative works under the HCL as you would with the GPL, or give back to the community proportionally to value you received. The second option is intentionally ambiguous and allows for a wide range of interpretations and usage flexibility while still retaining a lesser viral quality. In the event that there is a license dispute over whether the user has met the requirement of giving back proportional the Hive Commons community will use liquid democratic voting implementation to serve as final arbitrator in the dispute.</p>
<p>This makes it so resources within the Hive Commons are more accessible to businesses than software licensed under the GPL, but gives activist contributors more assurance that their contributions will have a lasting positive impact on the community as a whole.</p>

<p>Ultimately there are far fewer people who can develop software then there are members of the public, so to maximize the network effect of the movement and allow more public participation its also important that everyone has a straightforward way to contribute to the commons. A good way to do that is by funding labor and development efforts of others in order to grow the commons.</p>
<p>The mechanism must be simple, standardized, and most importantly provide accountability to the community in order to be successful. The platform should enable funders to curate and fund projects, and provide an accountability guarantee in the form of milestone driven development and vesting schedules.</p>
<p>The 1Hive Funding Platform district proposal is a good first step towards this goal, with the notable lack of a way for project contributors to fund and vote on the release of additional milestone driven bounties. Once the Hive Democracy voting mechanism is ready, this can easily be added such that anyone may claim a bounty, and then the funders could vote to release the funds.</p>
<p>This funding platform would enable community members to provide an incentive for developers to initially contribute to the commons, bootstrapping the community until the viral aspect of the HCL licenses begins to take effect and create a positive feedback loop.</p>
